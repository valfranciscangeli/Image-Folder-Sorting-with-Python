Image Folder Sorting Code

These programs rename and order all the images you have in a folder. This idea arose since I had many photos on my computer that were impossible to review by a human in a short time. If you want to maximize the use of these, follow these steps:

1. Start with image_renaming.py in order to rename all photos in the same format wich is YYYYMMDD_HHDDSS_ID.ext
2. Continue with image_sorting.py if you have a large amount of photos or if ypu want then sorted in different folders by year taken.
3. Finally run image_comparator.py in every sub-folder. I want to create a version that goes through every sub-folder automatically in the future.
